                    </b>
                    <br>
                    <li> Lakshmibai was the queen of Maratha princely state of Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh, India.
                        Today is the 162nd death anniversary of Lakshmibai.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Rani Lakshmibai was born as Manikarnika Tambe on November 19, 1828, in a Marathi
                        Karhade Brahmin family to Moropant Tambe (Father) and Bhagirathi Sapre (Mother).
                        Lakshmibai's mother died when she was four years old. Her father worked for
                        Peshwa Baji Rao II of Bithoor district. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Rani Lakshmibai was educated at home and could read and write. She was also trained
                        for shooting, horsemanship, fencing and mallakhamba. She has three horse--
                        Sarangi, Pavan and Badal. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>In May 1852, Manikarnika was married to Gangadhar Rao Newalkar (Maharaja of Jhansi)
                        and was later names as Lakshmibai as per the traditions. In 1851, Lakshmibai
                        gave birth to her son Damodar Rao who died after 4 months. The couple later
                        adopted Gangadhar Rao's cousin, who was renamed, Damodar Rao. The procedure of
                        adaption was carried out in the presence of a British officer. A letter was
                        handed to the officer from the Maharaja with the instructions that the adopted
                        child should be given due respect and Jhansi should be given to Lakshmibai for
                        her entire lifetime. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>However, in November 1853, after the death of Maharaja, British East India Company,
                        applied Doctrine of Lapse, under the Governor-General Lord Dalhousie. Under this
                        policy, Damodar Rao's claim to the throne was rejected as he was adopted son of
                        Maharaja and Rani. In March 1854, Lakshmibai was given Rs. 60,000 as annual
                        pension and was asked to leave the palace. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>On June 17, in Kotah-ki-Serai near the Phool Bagh of Gwalior, the British forces
                        charged the Indian forces commanded by Rani Lakshmibai. The British Army killed
                        5,000 Indian soldiers. Rani Lakshmibai was unhorsed and was wounded. There are
                        two views on her death: Some people say that she was bleeding on the roadside
                        and upon recognising the soldier fired at him. She was dispatched with his
                        carbine. However, another view is that she was dressed as a cavalry leader and
                        was badly wounded. Rani did not want the British forces to capture her body and
                        told hermit to burn it. Rani Lakshmibai died on June 18, 1858. </li>
